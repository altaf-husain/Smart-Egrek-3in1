This project involves the development of a cocoa fruit picker, ripeness detector, and sorter that uses sensor technology to enhance the productivity of cocoa plants. The device integrates an egrek (traditional cocoa harvesting tool) equipped with a servo motor that moves to cut the cocoa fruit when the color sensor detects the chlorophyll level of the cocoa fruit, particularly for high-hanging fruits. Once detected, the cocoa fruit falls into a cart with compartments equipped with servo-controlled gates, which sort the fruit based on ripeness levels and detect any fruit damaged by disease.

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to create an efficient system for harvesting, detecting ripeness, and sorting cocoa fruits, thereby increasing productivity and ensuring the quality of the harvested cocoa.

## Key Features
- **Automated Harvesting**: The device uses a servo motor to cut the cocoa fruit when ripeness is detected.
- **Ripeness Detection**: Equipped with a color sensor to detect the chlorophyll level, determining the fruit's ripeness.
- **Sorting Mechanism**: Fruits are sorted into compartments based on ripeness and disease detection.
- **Efficiency**: Designed to handle high-hanging fruits and reduce manual labor.
- **Quality Control**: Ensures only ripe and healthy fruits are collected, improving overall crop quality.

## Technologies Used
- **Servo Motor**: For cutting the cocoa fruit and controlling sorting gates.
- **Color Sensor**: To detect the chlorophyll level and determine the ripeness of the cocoa fruit.
- **Compartmentalized Cart**: Equipped with servo-controlled gates to sort fruits based on ripeness and health.
- **Microcontroller**: To process sensor data and control servo motors.

## Working Principle
1. **Detection**: The color sensor detects the chlorophyll level in the cocoa fruit to determine its ripeness.
2. **Cutting**: The servo motor activates the egrek to cut the ripe fruit.
3. **Collection**: The harvested fruit falls into a cart with compartments.
4. **Sorting**: Servo-controlled gates sort the fruit into different compartments based on ripeness and the presence of any disease.

## Components Used
- **Servo Motor**: To control the cutting mechanism and sorting gates.
- **Color Sensor**: To detect the ripeness of the cocoa fruit.
- **Microcontroller**: To process sensor data and control the servo motors.
- **Cart with Compartments**: To collect and sort the harvested fruits.
